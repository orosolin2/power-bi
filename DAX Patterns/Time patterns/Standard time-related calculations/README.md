This pattern is implemented using regular DAX time intelligence functinos.</br>

It  works bases on the assumption that your calendar is a regular Gregorian calendar and that your fiscal calendar starts at the beggining of a Gregorian quarter.</br>

If your are using a regfular Gregorian calendar, then the formulas in this pattern are the easiest and most effective way of producing time intelligence calculations. Keep in mind that standard DAX time intelligence functions only support a regular Gregorian calendar - that is a calendar witrh 12 months, each month with its Gregorian number of days, quarters made up of three months, and all the regular aspects of a calendar that we are used to.
