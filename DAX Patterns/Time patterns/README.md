## Time patterns
https://www.daxpatterns.com/time-patterns/

A time-related calculation refers to any calculation that involves time.</br>

Examples include the set of period-to date calculations, like year-to-date, quarter-to-date, or 
month-to-date.</br>

These calculations accumulate values from the beggining of a time period - year, quarter, month - 
and they return the aggregation of the measure from the start of the period to the date shown in 
the report.</br>

The definition of a time period changes depending on wheter you work with the Gregorian calendar 
or a fiscal calendar.</br>

Included in these patterns are also comparisons of a parameter over a certain period od time, with a 
different period of time. For example, you can compare the sales of the current month against the sales of
the same month in the previous year.</br>

Another example of time-related calculations is the moving average over a time period, like a rolling 
average over 12 months which smoothes out line charts and removes the effect of seasonality from 
calculations.</br>

What makes the patterns so different from one another, is the definition of what a calendar is. Depending
on whether you are working with the Gregorian or the fiscal calendar, the numbers are different.
